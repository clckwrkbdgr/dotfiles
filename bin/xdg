# Script to ensure up-to-date XDG environment.
# Needed primarily for crontab or DE actions (keybindings etc)
# because XDG environment is loaded once a session in login shell (via profile).
# Has two different usage cases:
# - Can be sourced in current shell to load latest changes in XDG environment.
# - Can be used as runnable script to run programs in such environment.
# Besides these, it has no point.
# Both results can also be achieved using ~/.config/bin/crontab-env.cmd
# TODO need to rename crontab-env into something like with-profile or with-user-env (?)
